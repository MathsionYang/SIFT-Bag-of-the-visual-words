# SIFT-Bag-of-the-visual-words
This repository is an implementation of SIFT using OpenCV incorporing Bag-of-visual-words (BoW) to feature extraction for machine learning algorithms

First of all is generate the dictionaries of words, then run the ```siftOCV.cpp``` for generate feature of one image

> NOTE: In machine learning is not commonly use only one image for tasks, this algorithm runs only for one, then you must adapt then for your need.
